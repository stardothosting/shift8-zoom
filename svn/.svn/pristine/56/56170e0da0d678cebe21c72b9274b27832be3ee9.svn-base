This is a plugin that integrates a 100% free CDN service operated by Shift8, for your Wordpress site. What this means is that you can simply install this plugin, activate and register with our CDN service and all of your static assets on your website will be served through our global content delivery network.

== Instructions for setup ==

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Navigate to settings page (Shift8 -> CDN Settings)
3. Make sure the "Site URL" and "Your Email" fields are correct and populated.
4. Click the "Save Changes" button
5. Click the green "Register" button.
6. Once registered, the Api Key and CDN prefix fields will be populated and saved automatically
7. Refresh the settings page and a "Test URL" link will appear. It takes a few minutes for your site to be registered and populated on our systems. Once the Test URL works (it should load a test image), you can switch on the CDN by clicking the ON/OFF button for "Enable Shift8 CDN".
8. All urls for media and static assets will be automatically rewritten to the CDN url. Any problems encountered can be resolved by turning off the CDN by switching off the "Enable Shift8 CDN" setting.

== Newly added entpoints ==

New endpoints added : 

- Warsaw, Poland
- Singapore
- Dallas, TX, USA
- Miami, FL, USA

== Free Content Delivery Network for your Static Content ==

[Shift8](https://www.shift8web.ca) has rolled out a consistently-growing CDN with endpoints all over the world. This plugin will make your site load way faster by using latency-based and geographic-based DNS resolution for requests made to your site to be served by an endpoint closest to the user making the request. This means that a user making a request in Mumbai, India will hit the Mumbai server to download the static content from your website, improving performance remarkably.

Current endpoints in use (more added regularly) :

1. USA - Northern California
2. USA - Northern Virginia
3. USA - Dallas, TX
4. USA - Miami, FL
5. Canada - Toronto
6. Europe - London, England 
7. Europe - Stockholm, Sweden
8. Europe - Warsaw, Poland
9. Asia Pacific - Hong Kong, China
10. Asia Pacific - Tokyo, Japan
11. Asia Pacific - Sydney, Australia
12. Asia Pacific - Singapore
13. Asia Pacific - Mumbai, India
14. Latin America - Sao Paulo, Brazil

You can learn more about how the CDN was setup and how it works by reading our [blog post](https://www.shift8web.ca/2019/05/how-we-created-our-own-free-content-delivery-network-for-wordpress-users/).

= I noticed on lazy load images, the CDN isnt being used =

This is a known issue with how lazy loading is implemented in some scenarios. Currently if you want the CDN to be used for lazy load images, you have to turn lazy load off.
