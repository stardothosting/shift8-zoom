This is a plugin that integrates a 100% free CDN service operated by Shift8, for your Wordpress site. What this means is that you can simply install this plugin, activate and register with our CDN service and all of your static assets on your website will be served through our global content delivery network.

== Free Content Delivery Network for your Static Content ==

[Shift8](https://www.shift8web.ca) has rolled out a consistently-growing CDN with endpoints all over the world. This plugin will make your site load way faster by using latency-based and geographic-based DNS resolution for requests made to your site to be served by an endpoint closest to the user making the request. This means that a user making a request in Mumbai, India will hit the Mumbai server to download the static content from your website, improving performance remarkably.

Current endpoints in use (more added regularly) :

1. USA - Northern California
2. USA - Northern Virginia
3. Canada - Toronto
4. Europe - London, England 
5. Europe - Stockholm, Sweden
6. Asia Pacific - Hong Kong, China
7. Asia Pacific - Tokyo, Japan
8. Asia Pacific - Sydney, Australia
9. Asia Pacific - Mumbai, India
10. Latin America - Sao Paulo, Brazil
